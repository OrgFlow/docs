A delta archive is a compressed (`.zip`) file that contains a representation of metadata differences. The differences can be additions, deletions, or edits to existing items.

Delta archives can be used to compare two sets of metadata, and they are also used during deployment processes ([see this guide in the Salesforce documentation for more information](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_deploy.htm)).
