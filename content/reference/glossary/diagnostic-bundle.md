title: Diagnostic Bundle
---

OrgFlow can create a diagnostic bundle whenever a command fails. The diagnostic bundle is a compressed archive file containing files that represent the state that OrgFlow was in when it failed.

It's useful for troubleshooting, and you may be asked to provide a copy of it to support if you are experiencing issues.

> [!WARNING]
> Please check the contents of the bundle before sharing it as it may inadvertently contain information that you are not comfortable sharing.
