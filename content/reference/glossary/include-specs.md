An include spec is a rule that indicates to OrgFlow whether a particular metadata package, namespace, type, or item should be processed by OrgFlow. Include spec rules can be combined to create a rich and powerful filtering syntax.

> [!TIP]
> See @reference_includespecssyntax for more information on the syntax of include specs.

For @concept_stackbasedcommands, your @concept_orgflowincludefile contains your include specs. @concept_orgbasedcommands that require include specs will have an argument that allows you to pass a delimited string of include specs (see the reference page for each command for more information).
