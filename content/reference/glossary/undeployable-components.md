title: Undeployable Components
---

During the @concept_flowout process, some components may not be able to be deployed. These components are referred to as 'undeployable components'.

Undeployable components are significant because OrgFlow needs to know about them in order to support @concept_bidirectionalmetadata. A record of which components were undeployable is kept in the @concept_statestore on the @concept_environmentstate record for the @concept_environment in question.
