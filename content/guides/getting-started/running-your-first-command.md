Now that you've got OrgFlow installed, let's run a command.

Open a command prompt or terminal:

## [Windows](#tab/win)

1. Press `START`
1. Type `cmd`
1. Press `ENTER` on your keyboard

## [macOS](#tab/mac)

1. Hold down the command key (`âŒ˜`) and press the `SPACE` bar to open Spotlight
1. Type `Terminal` so search for the Terminal application
1. Double click the Terminal app icon that should be highlighted in Spotlight

## [Linux](#tab/linux)

If you're using Linux, we'll go ahead and assume that you already know how to open the terminal.

Just make sure that your current directory is the directory that you unzipped the OrgFlow executable to.

***

At the terminal prompt, type `orgflow --help` and press enter to run the command.

That's it- you've just executed your first OrgFlow command.

The command you've executed was the 'help' command (`orgflow --help`). It displays a list of things you can do with OrgFlow, and how to do them. You can run this command at any time if you get stuck, or need a reminder on how to do something.
