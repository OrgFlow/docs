title: Installing OrgFlow
---

OrgFlow is cross platform, and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. Use the tabs to follow the instructions for the computer you are working on.

## [Windows](#tab/win)

Head to the download page and download the latest installer (`.msi`) for Windows.

Run the installer, accepting all the default values (make sure that you agree to the EULA before accepting). The installer will copy the OrgFlow executable into place, as well as updating your PATH environment variable so that you can run OrgFlow from any location.

That's it! You're ready to run your first command.

## [macOS](#tab/mac)

Head to the download page and download the latest installer (`.pkg`) for macOS.

Run the installer, accepting all the default values (make sure that you agree to the EULA before accepting). The installer will copy the OrgFlow executable into place, as well as creating a symbolic link so that you can run OrgFlow from any location.

That's it! You're ready to run your first command.

## [Linux](#tab/linux)

Head to the download page and download the latest packaged version (`.zip`) for Linux.

Once downloaded, extract it to your preferred location on disk.

That's it! You're ready to run your first command.
