One of the benefits of OrgFlow is that it runs locally on your computer. This means that your metadata is never downloaded to (or processed on) a remote, third-party's server in the cloud.

This getting started guide will get you up and running in no time.

At the end of this guide, you'll have:

- installed OrgFlow onto your computer
- run your first command
- initialized your first @concept_stack and added an @concept_environment
- looked at your metadata in the @concept_remotegitrepository
- flowed metadata from your sandbox to your remote Git repository, and vice versa

OrgFlow is extremely versatile, which means that there will usually be more than one way to build out your processes and workflows. These guides will keep things simple and take you through techniques and concepts one at a time. As you work through the guides and build up your knowledge, you should begin to feel confident to design OrgFlow based processes that are best suited to your requirements.
