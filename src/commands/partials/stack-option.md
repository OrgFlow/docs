- **`--stack=<stackName>`**
  
  The name of the stack to target. Stack names are case-insensitive. Stacks are specific to license keys, and you can see a list of all available stacks with the @command_stack_list command.

  This value is required if no valid default stack has been set, or if you would like to target a stack other than the one that is currently the default stack. You can use the @command_stack_setdefault command to set or change the default stack.
