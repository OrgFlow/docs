OrgFlow is a cross platform devops tool for Salesforce. OrgFlow is scriptable, automatable, and can be integrated into almost any existing devops tool or pipeline.

## Why OrgFlow?
There are already a number of tools available for Salesforce deployments. Some may even claim to be DevOps tools. We believe that OrgFlow is the first, and only, complete DevOps tool for Salesforce.

Instead of trying to compete with the great build, test, deployment, and change tracking tools already out there, we decided to build a product that allows you to use these tools with Salesforce. Everything that OrgFlow can do is scriptable; this means that you can automate a lot of your change tracking, metadata backup, and deployments.

If you prefer point and click, you can use that too. Whether you're low code, no code, or pro code, OrgFlow can streamline your change tracking, testing, and deployments.

## How to get started
You'll find a series of helpful guides and samples on this website. Each command also has an in-depth reference page if you want to fine tune your usage.

We recommend that you start by [familiarising yourself with some of the core concepts of OrgFlow](guides_coreconcepts). But we won't discourage you if you just want to jump right in. You'll need:
* Access to a Salesforce org
* [A Git repository](guides_git)
* [A copy of OrgFlow](guides_download)
